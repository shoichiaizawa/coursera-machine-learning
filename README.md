### About this repository

This is my other note repository for [Machine Learning - Stanford University](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course offered at [Coursera.org](https://www.coursera.org/). The notes are currently being used for the session between **2015-11-30** and **2016-02-22**.

At this time, the notes are very disorganised, as in the large part of the text is very exact copy (but typed by me) of the original one given by Professor Ng and other Coursera community members – I will try to summarise the notes as much as possible whenever I can.

### My objective for this course

I decided to take this course as a paid course so my minimum objective for this course is to complete it successfully within the given time frame; this includes submitting every assignment by its due date.

My goal after completing this course is, likewise other learners I came across on the internet, to implement the course materials taught using Octave/MATLAB into a different programing language – **Python** will probably be my language of choice.

### Terms of Use for Coursera.org

Please note that there is no assignment related file is stored within this repository; they are in my local computer but excluded with the `.gitignore` file.

I am believing that what I do in this repository is legit, however, that said, I would be grateful to anyone kindly enough to point me out any of my possible infringement of the [Honour Code](https://www.coursera.org/about/terms/honorcode) OR the other [Terms of Use](https://www.coursera.org/about/terms) at Coursera.org. In such cases, I will make an immediate action on those files.
